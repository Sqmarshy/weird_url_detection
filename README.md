# Weird URL Detection

A simple repository for detecting suspicious or "weird" URLs. This project aims to demonstrate methods and heuristics that can help flag potentially malicious or suspicious URLs in various contexts (such as phishing detection).

## Overview

Suspicious or malicious URLs often exhibit patterns that differ from benign URLs—for instance, odd subdomains, unusual parameter usage, or encodings designed to trick users. This repository explores a few approaches for detecting such URLs.

**Key goals**:
- Provide simple scripts or code snippets that quickly evaluate the "weirdness" of a URL.
- Demonstrate a few different heuristics and possible expansions with machine learning (e.g., feed these features into a classifier).

## Features

- **Heuristic-based checks**: Looks at domain structure, path patterns, and common phishing keywords.
- **Statistical-based checks**: Simple frequency analysis of characters or subdomains.
- **Extensible**: The detection logic can be easily updated or expanded based on new patterns or threats.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sqmarshy/weird_url_detection.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the cloned directory**:
    ```bash
    cd weird_url_detection
    ```
3. **Install dependencies** (if any):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   *If there is no `requirements.txt`, skip this step.*

## Usage

1. **Run the script** (replace `example.py` with the actual file name if different):
    ```bash
    python example.py
    ```
2. **Input/Output**:
    - The script may prompt you for a URL or read from a file containing URLs.
    - It will output whether or not the URL is considered “weird” based on the current logic.

### Command Line Arguments (If Applicable)
- `--file <path>`: Specify a file containing multiple URLs for batch detection.
- `--verbose`: Enable detailed logging of the detection process.

Adjust the commands to match the actual script(s) in this repository.
